</h2>
        <div class="square ">
            <div class="benefict-title">Stress reduction</div>
            <div class="benefict-body"> Leave the overbooked scheduling at home. When you’re camping, there’s no place to be at a certain time, and there’s nothing interrupting you or competing for your attention. The natural outcome of this type of setting is stress reduction and relaxation like you can’t find anywhere else.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="square ">
            <div class="benefict-title">Fresh air</div>
            <div class="benefict-body">You may not realize how scarce fresh air is in your day to day life. When you go camping, you get the wondrous scents of the outdoors, as well as the smell of dinner cooking over an open fire.

        <div class="square ">
            <div class="benefict-title">Relationship building</div>
            <div class="benefict-body">One of the best and most important aspects of camping is how it helps you build and strengthen relationships. When you go camping with friends or family, you get a chance to talk and visit without distraction, even late into the night.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="square ">
            <div class="benefict-title">Physical fitness</div>
            <div class="benefict-body">Time spent camping is physical time. You set up a tent, gather firewood, go for a hike. At home, we often lead sedentary lives that do not promote physical fitness. When you’re camping, you can’t help but engage in physical activity and get your heart rate up.. </div>
        </div>
        <div class="square ">
            <div class="benefict-title">Lack of alarm clocks</div>
            <div class="benefict-body"> When was the last time you slept late without an alarm clock to wake you up? When you’re camping, the only alarm clocks you have are the sun and the chirping of birds. Waking up with nature rather than an alarm clock is an experience everyone should have regularly.
</div>

        <div class="square ">
            <div class="benefict-title">Unplugging</div>
            <div class="benefict-body">Camping is a great chance for everyone to unplug and get away from their screens. In the great outdoors, you don’t find computers, tablets or televisions and there’s so much else to do that does not require electronics.
